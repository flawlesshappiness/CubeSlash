IDEAS:
enemy that pushes the player
enemy that pulls the player
waves that push things in a direction
endless mode
shielded enemy with a dud on its back

CHARM: Orbiting damage
CHARM: Gain x when y

progress bar on lose game (see how far you got) (might be good to keep the mystery?)
test cooldown reduce upgrades
refund more? 50%?
difficulties increase max area count?
physics objects in the world are fun. Hazards? Affect both player and enemy?
cooldown reduc should affect charge

TODO:
split mod dash > ???
charge mod split > change to beams from death?
chain mod mines > ???

more health on easy?
ability off cooldown sound
update exp bar
players dont understand how exp works
split early game very weak
back dud on shooter boss is very hard to hit
plant boss very rough when late (area based on how late it is?)
duds bigger on easier difficulties
enemy speed based on difficulty
max enemies based on difficulty
if split is dependent on a single upgrade, then that upgrade is not enough
split collect exp
dash hit multi cell damage
