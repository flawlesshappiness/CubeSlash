## TODO ##
explode charge sound effect
shield upgrade is boring

dodge action
heal action

## BUGS ##
what happens if there are no more upgrades to unlock?
parallax sprites z fighting

## MAYBE ##
geode area with splitting enemies and boss
abyss area with enemies that teleport using bite move
more health on easy - health static no matter what ability you choose
difficulties increase max area count?
Spend many DNA points to upgrade health and other stats

Mushroom bodypart

Boomerang ability
Split modifier > Penetrate?
