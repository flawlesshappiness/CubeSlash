## TODO ##
rootpull needs to be stronger and stack less
max speed is too much
explosion is too weak in the beginning
increase camera size based on area index
camera look ahead based on speed
missing ability tooltips
test if player bodies are unlocked correctly
player body notif is always on
it is unclear if some things are danger on touch (add red outline)
body edit mirror part
too many crystal body parts (each body part should be distinct)
shield upgrade is boring
dash ability is bad
usually you only want one ability
enemies tend to clump together or move into objects
ability cooldown UI and health ui is too far away from play area

## BUGS ##

## MAYBE ##
geode area with splitting enemies and boss
abyss area with enemies that teleport using bite move
more health on easy - health static no matter what ability you choose
difficulties increase max area count?
Spend many DNA points to upgrade health and other stats
enemy speed based on difficulty
max enemies based on difficulty

IDEAS:
enemy that pushes the player
enemy that pulls the player
enemy that shoots aoe of bullets
enemy that leaves a trail during life / after death
enemy with a dud on its back
