TODO:
Player body based on ability runes
Dash do a raycast before dashing
escaping boss kills it

bonus on multiple enemies in a row
maybe adjust auto targetting charge
maybe give charge aoe
need a big enemy variation
split feels underpowered (add more bullets / lifetime)
charge multiple buttons at the same time
