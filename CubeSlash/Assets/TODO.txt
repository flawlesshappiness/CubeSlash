TODO:
Player body based on ability runes
Dash do a raycast before dashing
escaping boss kills it
charge + dash not working
better graphic when hitting enemies
charge + dash might be hitting high health enemies multiple times

Phil feedback:
bonus on multiple enemies in a row
maybe adjust auto targetting charge
maybe give charge aoe
need a big enemy variation
split feels underpowered (add more bullets / lifetime)
charge multiple buttons at the same time

WORKING ON:

COMPLETED:
Fix split projectile spread

Add trigger size to dash modified by split
Fix trail on dash modified by split
Ability cooldown
Ability cooldown UI

Fixed event system allowing null selected object
Fixed can start a new level while also entering loadout
